# GunChecksTableauProject

This phrase outlines a process of analyzing gun background checks within the United States, employing two primary tools for this purpose: MySQL and Tableau. MySQL, a popular database management system, is likely used to store and organize data related to the checks, while Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, is employed to graphically represent and interpret this data, thus facilitating a clearer understanding of patterns, trends, and insights within the information.
